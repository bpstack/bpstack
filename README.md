{ role: "Full-Stack by Default" }

Self-taught developer who fell in love with building things.

My learning path? Googling error messages nonstop, deep-diving into Stack Overflow, and watching countless YouTube tutorials — old-school & solo fixing since my first PC (1997). I was on IRC before Discord existed — back when many software projects like Linux and Ubuntu were born.

I’ve spent years shipping tools for the hospitality industry and beyond.  
Built hotel management systems, dashboards for school associations (parenting teaches: opportunities to build show up everywhere), and custom workflow automations for friends.

Today, I build full-stack apps from scratch: end-to-end hotel management platforms, databases, web apps, and e-commerce sites — backend, frontend, and everything in between.  
Currently building **Four-Points**, a comprehensive hotel management system.

💼 **Built**
- Hotel PMS systems  
- Internal tools  
- PTA web apps (Parent–Teacher Association)  
- E-commerce platforms  

🛠️ **Stack**
- Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- Node.js  
- MySQL  
- Whatever works

> Let the AI handle the easy parts, test everything, cut the useless bits — build things people actually use.  
> Keep shipping.
