Self-taught developer who fell in love with building things.

My learning path? Googling error messages nonstop, deep-diving into Stack Overflow, and watching countless YouTube tutorials — old-school & solo fixing since my first PC (1997). I was on IRC long before Discord existed — in the early days of projects like Linux and Ubuntu.

— My mentors —

I’ve spent years shipping tools for the hospitality industry and beyond.  
Built hotel management systems, dashboards for school associations (parenting teaches: opportunities to build show up everywhere), and custom workflow automations for friends.

Today, I build full-stack apps from scratch: end-to-end hotel management platforms, databases, web apps, and e-commerce sites — backend, frontend, and everything in between.  
Currently building **Four-Points**, a comprehensive hotel management system.

💼 **Built**
- Hotel PMS systems  
- Internal tools (go check my portfolio)  
- PTA web apps (Parent–Teacher Association)  
- E-commerce platforms  

🛠️ **Stack**
- React / Next.js  
- TypeScript  
- Node.js / Express 
- MySQL & PostgreSQL
- Whatever works  

`process.env.PHILOSOPHY`  
> Let the AI handle the easy parts, test everything, cut the useless bits — build things people actually use.  
> Keep shipping.
