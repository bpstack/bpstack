Self-taught developer who fell in love with building things. { role: "Full-Stack by Default" }

My learning path? Googling error messages nonstop, deep-diving into Stack Overflow, and watching countless YouTube tutorials — old-school & solo fixing since my first PC (1997). I was on IRC long before Discord existed — in the early days of projects like Linux and Ubuntu.

I’ve spent years shipping tools for the hospitality industry and beyond.  
Built hotel management systems, dashboards for school associations (parenting teaches: opportunities to build show up everywhere), and custom workflow automations for friends.

Today, I build full-stack apps from scratch: end-to-end hotel management platforms, databases, web apps, and e-commerce sites — backend, frontend, and everything in between.  
Currently building **Four-Points**, a comprehensive hotel management system.
