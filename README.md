{ role: 'Full-Stack by Default' }

Self-taught developer who fell in love with building things.

My learning path? Googling error messages nonstop, Stack Overflow deep dives, and countless YouTube tutorials - oldschool & solo fixing since first PC @1997. I was on IRC before Discord existed — where a lot of software projects, like Linux and Ubuntu, were born.

I’ve spent years shipping tools for hospitality industry and beyond. Built hotel management systems, dashboards for school associations (parenting teaches: chance to build appear in every domain), and custom workflow automations for friends.

Today, I build full-stack apps from scratch: end-to-end hotel management platforms, databases, web apps, and e-commerce sites—backend, frontend, and everything in between. Currently building Four-Points—a comprehensive hotel management system.
